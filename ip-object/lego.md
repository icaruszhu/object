# Lego Bricks 

## 1. Object Information

- Name: Lego Bricks

- Date:  28th January 1958 (the date when Lego bricks were applied for patent and design) 

- IP Rights: Copyright, Design

- Key case:

   + *Interlego AG v Tyco Industries Inc(Hong Kong) [1989] A.C. 217.*

- Material readings: Lego bricks are toy building bricks which could be assembled together with the knob-and-tube coupling system. 

## 2. Object Summary 

Lego is a system of model-building which consists of 'variously coloured interlocking plastic bricks, accompanying with an array of gears, figurines  and various other parts'.[^1] Lego bricks are well-known plastic construction toys produced by the Lego Group. Lego bricks were applied for patent and design protection in 1958 . However, after the patent and design expired in 1975, the Lego Group could not stop other competitors from producing Lego bricks. The Tyco Industries was one of the competitors who manufactured and sold similar plastic blocks in the US and Hong Kong with much lower price in 1982. Then Lego sued against Tyco industries for infringing its copyright in the design drawings of the bricks.



The key issues of this case is firstly, whether the bricks qualified for registered design protection and thus did not qualify for copyright protection. Secondly, whether the changes made to the re-drawings could sustain a claim to copyright protection.

## 4.  Legal Dispute 

The claimant of this case is Interlego A.G., a company holding the intellectual property rights of the Lego group, who engaged in manufacturing and selling the well-known construction toy—Lego. In 1958, the Lego company improved the original design of bricks and protected its stud-and-tube interlocking capabilities both by patent and by registering a design under the Registered Design Act 1949. The design and patent then expired in 1975. In 1983, the defendant, Tyco Industries Inc which was a US toy manufacturer, decided to manufacture similar plastic blocks with its subsidiary  in the US and in Hong Kong. Since the patents and designs of Lego bricks had expired, they purchased the Lego products and copied the design without seeing the drawings. Then Tyco manufactured and sold their toy products which were not only similar with Lego, but also capable of being combined with Lego with a very competitive price. Lego claimed that by measuring and reproducing the configurations of Lego, Tyco had infringed their copyright in the design drawings form.



A change of application of law should be considered in the meantime.  Any work made after 1st January 1973 was subject to the Copyright (Hong Kong) Order 1972, which is an application of the provisions of the United Kingdom Copyright Act 1956. Any work made prior to that time was subject to transitional provisions in the Seventh Schedule to the 1956 Act.



Lego brought an action in Hong Kong to restrain the breach of their copyright.  The high court of Hong Kong granted an injunction restraining the defendants from infringing the claimant's copyright in all the specified drawings in 1986. Then the defendant appealed to the Court of  Appeal of Hong Kong, the court allowed in part of the defendants' appeal, holding that copyright did not subsist in the pre-1973 drawings, since according to para.8(2) of Sch.7 to the Copyright Act 1956, the drawings were capable of registration under the Registered Designs Act 1949. But the copyright subsist in the post-1973 drawings. Although they were re-drawings and derived from the earlier works, those post-1973 drawings were original. The court held a view that 'the originality is depended upon the amount of labour, skill and judgment which went into the drawings in respect of which copyright was claimed.'[^2] Then the claimant appealed and the defendants cross-appealed to the the Privy Council (Hong Kong).



The principle issue in this case is whether Lego had copyright in its bricks before and after 1973. The Privy Council (Hong Kong) held that firstly, for the copyright issue of pre-1972 drawings, the claimant's bricks were not designed solely for the purpose of working well, they also had notions in the artistic sense. 'Since the bricks had visual appeal not related solely to their mechanical function, each of the pre-1973 drawings was a registrable 'design' within s. 1(3) of the 1949 Act. [^3]Therefore, according to para.8(2) of Sch.7 to the Copyright Act 1956, those designs were capable of registration and therefore no copyright subsisted in them. Secondly, regarding the post-1972 drawings, since they were re-drawings of pre-1973 and no substantial differences were made during the copying process, they were not original artistic works and were not able to be protected with copyright under s.3(2) of the Copyright Act 1956. 'The amount of skill, judgment or labour is not warranted as a universal test of originality in all copyright cases'.[^4]In this case, skill, labour or judgment in the process of copying cannot suffice to make the totality of the work an original work. Thirdly, by substantially reproduced Lego's post-1972 drawings, the defendants had infringed the copyright of the base-plate and trailer wheel which were original artistic works. Therefore the defendants' cross-appeal on these two items was dismissed.


##  5. What Does the Judge Say
- On the question of how far a drawing which was substantially copied from a previous drawing was itself entitled to copyright as an 'original' work, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton stated that[^4]:
>  There must in addition be some element of material alteration or embellishment which suffices to make the totality of the work an original work.....The prolongation of the period of statutory protection by periodic reproduction of the original work with minor alterations is an operation which requires to be scrutinized with some caution to ensure that for which protection is claimed really is an original artistic work.

## 6. Fun Fact 
The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen in Denmark. At the very beginning, Lego only produced wooden toys. The name ‘Lego’ is an abbreviation of the two Danish words ‘*leg godt*’, meaning ‘play well’. [^5]

## 7. Linked knowledge 
- [explanatory text]
  + This case has 'prevented the proprietor of a design from protecting it in perpetuity by producing a succession of drawings containing superficial modifications but conveying ideas by way of technical information superimposed on the drawings themselves'. [^6] For companies like Lego, it is important for them to seek for new ways to maintain their competitiveness after their patents or designs expired.
