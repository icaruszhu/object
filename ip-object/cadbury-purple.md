  Societe des Produits Nestle SA v Cadbury UK Ltd [2013] EWCA Civ 1174
- Material readings: The object is intangible. It could be read by a colour sample, or be defined by international recognised identification code like The Pantone, along with a verbal description.

## 2. Object Summary 

The claimant Societe des Produits Nestle SA ('Nestle' for short) and the defendant Cadbury UK Ltd (‘Cadbury’ for short) are two rival chocolate companies, which disputed over whether a shade of purple could be registered as a trade mark for chocolate. 

In light of the case of this object, a colour itself is capable of being a sign for the trade mark purpose. However, whether a colour can be registered as a trade mark is in fact a sign in a given context depends on the facts and circumstances. Although a pure colour mark was in principle capable of being registered as a trade mark according to the *Libertel* case, the colour trade mark should also satisfy the tests of being clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.

## 4. Legal issues

In 2004, Cadbury applied to register a distinctive purple colour, which was defined as Pantone 2685c, as a trade mark for its chocolate. In the application form, Cadbury described the purple colour as 'applied to the whole visible surface, or being the predominant colour applied to the whole visible surface, of the packaging of the goods'. [^1] Cadbury also filed the evidence of distinctiveness acquired through use of the mark. The UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) accepted and published the application in 2008. Nestle was opposed to this application and appealed against this decision. The Principle Hearing Officer for the UKIPO heard the opposition in 2011. The Hearing Officer held that ‘the sample of the colour supplied on the form of application accompanied by the Pantone shade clearly satisfied the requirements of graphic representation laid down in *Libertel* '.[^2] He also pointed out the particularity of colour trade mark and believed that ‘if it were necessary to show by lines or contours how the colour looks when applied to each product, advertising media etc..then it would not be possible to register colour in the abstract. Rather, registration of colour would only be possible in the form of the ‘get-up’ of a particular product or promotional article'.[^3] Therefore, he rejected Nestle’s argument on the vagueness of the reference to ‘predominant colour’ in the description of the application and supported the previous decision which accepted Cadbury’s application.

Nestle then brought an action to the High Court in 2012 to appeal against the Hearing Officer’s decision. Nestle believed that the purple colour could not be registered under Directive 2008/95 Art 2 because firstly, it was not a sign capable of being represented graphically. Secondly, the description of this trade mark was indeterminate. The High Court dismissed the appeal and held that Cadbury was entitled to register the distinctive shade of purple as a trade mark for chocolate within Art 2 because firstly, a trade mark consisting of a colour per se was capable of satisfying Art 2 even though it could be used in an infinite variety of ways. Whether such a trade mark satisfied Art 2 depended on the context. Secondly, the colour was defined properly in words and with a Pantone code, which fulfilled the requirement of capable of being represented graphically. Thirdly, according to the evidence, the colour was distinctive of Cadbury for chocolate. The judge agreed with the standpoint of the Heading Officer that the reference of 'predominant colour' in the description of the application did not introduce vagueness or alternatives. It depended on the decision-maker’s judgement as to whether the colour was the predominant colour used on the visible packaging for a product or not. Therefore, Cadbury was entitled to register the purple colour as a trade mark, although the specification of goods needed to be limited to milk chocolate.


In 2013, Nestle appealed to the Court of Appeal. Nestle argued that firstly, the application was for a colour plus a verbal description of how the colour would be represented on packaging, not just a colour mark per se, therefore the judge of High Court had wrongly referred to the requirement in Art 2. Secondly, the word ‘predominant’ introduced elements of vagueness and subjectivity into the verbal description. The Court of Appeal allowed this appeal because the verbal description of the graphic representation referred not only to a shade of colour but also other material by using the word ‘predominant.’ Therefore, it did not meet the requirement of ‘a sign’ that was ‘represented graphically’. Thus, the description did not fulfil the requirement of clarity, precision, self-containment, durability and objectivity qualify for registration. The purple colour could not be registered as a trade mark.

## 5. What Does the Judge Say 

- At para 60 of the Court of Appeal ruling, Sir Timothy Lloyd explained that there are potential problems in seeking to register a colour trade mark:
> This evidently allows for the possibility that a sign consisting of a colour as such may have an acquired distinctive character, but the decision is that, in order to qualify for registration, even if it has become distinctive, it must satisfy the tests of being clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective, and that to reproduce the colour on paper is not enough, whereas reference to a suitable code may be.

## 6. Fun Fact

Cadbury chose the royal purple colour as a tribute to Queen Victoria. This colour shade has been used on their chocolate wrappers for more than 100 years.

## 7. Linked knowledge

- Explanatory text
  + 'A colour per se is something which exists at a conceptual level. Intellectual property law has historically, been unreceptive to entities seeking to claim exclusive rights in concepts'. [^4] As a consequence, the difficulty of registering a colour trade mark is how to describe the conceptual colours with certainty and precision to pass the *Sieckmann* test.
