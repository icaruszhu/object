## 2. Object Summary 

- Sidamo coffee is one of the three most popular and trademarked coffees produced in and exported from Ethiopia. The other two are: Harrar and Yirgacheffee. The coffee is named after the 'Sidamo' region in southern Ethiopia, which is one of the major coffee growing regions in Ethopia. The roasted Sidamo coffee beans are small and have a dinstinctively dark brown colour. Known for its strong chocolate, floral, berry and citrus notes mixed with a creamy, earthy and nutty taste, sidamo coffee is a staple in so many coffee shops across various parts of the world.

## 4. Legal Dispute
- The Ethiopian export market is highly reliant on coffee as the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) estimates coffee accounts for about 60% of Ethiopia's total export earnings.

  The country has a reputation for producing coffees with the highest retail values in the international market. However, there was a significant difference between the international retail value of Ethiopian coffees and the revenue received by the local Ethiopian farmers that produced the coffee for export.

  [^2]: **Ethiopia Trademarking and Licensing Initiative: Supporting a better deal for coffee producers through aid for trade**, Overseas Development Institute (ODI, 2009)

  In a bid to bridge the gap, the Ethiopian government launched the Ethiopian Coffee Trademarking and Licensing Initiative (the Initiative). The initiative was organized and run by the joint efforts of cooperatives, private exporters and the Ethiopian Intellectual Property Office (EIPO) under an umbrella committee described as 'the Ethiopian Fine Coffee Stakeholder Committee'.

- The aim of the initiative was to find mechanisms to increase the retail prices of the most popular Ethiopian coffee brands– Sidamo, Harrar and Yirgacheffee– in a bid to increase the revenue of the local coffee farmers in Ethiopia. To achieve this, the Committee's strategy was to ensure wide recognition of the distinctiveness of the Ethiopian coffees by claiming ownership of certain Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) on the coffees.

   The committee considered two options– Geographical Indication (GI) and Trademarks (TM) but decided not to pursue the GI route as it determined that it would be too expensive to implement; moreover, the coffees did not meet one of the most important conditions for GIs– production in a specific area of the country under specific circumtances (the condition). To fulfil the condition, it would mean the Ethiopian government would have to set up regulatory oversight to ensure the coffees are produced in line with specified circumtances. Even more so, the condition would imply that Sidamo would have to be exclusively produced in the Sidamo region of Ethiopia and have a special quality that is directly dependent on its production in the Sidamo region.

  However, unlike the name would suggest,  sidamo coffees are not all produced in the Sidamo region or under same circumstances. Independent coffee farmers grow the coffee across various remote areas throughout Ethiopia. These reasons made Trademark the most viable alternative, thus, protecting the commercial origin of the coffee. 

- The EIPO filed applications to register Sidamo as a trademark in key markets, including the Unites States, Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, China, South Africa, Australia. 

- Starbucks had sometime in 2004, which predated the EIPO application, filed an application at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to register 'Shirkina Sun-dried Sidamo' as a trademark.

  Upon receiving Ethiopia's application to register 'Sidamo' as a trademark, the USPTO informed the Ethiopia of Starbucks' earlier application and therefore suspended Ethiopia's application pending the disposition of Starbucks' application on grounds that the trademarks sought to be registered are distinctively similar and the products to which they relate to are same/similar goods.

- The Ethiopian Ambassador to the United States at the time attempted to engage discussions with Starbucks to resolve the issue amicably but the Ambassador's efforts did not yeild any positive results. 

- The Ethiopian Government susequently objected to the registration of the Starbucks' mark and filed an official opposition before the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (the appeal board). The opposition was based on two grounds
  
  [^8]: **The Coffee War: Ethiopia and the Starbucks Story**, World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) publication dated 3 September, 2010 (last updated 10 July 2012)
  
  - Likelihood of confusion between the two marks. Ethiopia supported this ground by stating that both marks were literally identical as the  dominant part of Starbucks' mark was 'Sidamo' while the 'Sun-dried' was merely a generic description; 
  - Registration of the Starbucks' mark would hinder the Ethiopian government's ability to protect its own mark. 
  
- The Appeal board decided in favour of Ethiopia. Starbucks subsequently filed a notice with the USPTO stating that it has abandoned its application to trademark 'Shirkina Sun-dried Sidamo'.

- With the Starbucks' application having been successfully opposed and abandoned, Ethiopia proceeded with its application  to trademark 'Sidamo' in the United States. 

- The USPTO refused the registration of Sidamo as it determined that the word was descriptive of the goods identified and therefore not eligible for registration under the US trademark law.

  [^9]: ibid. 

   The USPTO subsequently received a letter of protest from the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) objecting to the registration of Sidamo as a trademark. SCAA, in its opposition, relied on the ground that 'Sidamo' is descriptive of a variety of coffee, therefore, other stakeholders in the coffee industry should be able to use it. The SCAA opposition was prompted and majorly driven by Starbucks. The SCAA also held the view that protection as a GI would have been most appropriate as opposed to trademark registration, citing the example of Jamaica's Blue Mountain Coffee, which had earlier been successfully registered as a certification mark, in line with the recommendation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

  The Ethopian government, in response to this point, reiterated that trademarks offer more coverage and protection in terms of rights conferred in comparision to certification marks. Indeed, GIs are a subset of Trademark in the US

- The Ethiopian government also began executing licensing agreements with coffee retailers in the US. Under these agreements, the Ethiopian government granted royalty free license to use the trademark 'sidamo' as 'owners' of the mark. Starbucks initially refused an invitation by the Ethiopian government to execute one of these agreements. The refusal by Starbucks attracted criticism from various players in the US coffee industry with a massive campaign activated to force Starbucks into executing the agreement. Following pressure from other players in the US coffee industry and the general public to sign the 'royalty free' license agreement to use the name 'Sidamo', Starbuck, in an attempt to remedy the resulting negative PR, was willingly and indeed made a generous donation of up to $500,000 to an humanitarian cause (CARE) focused on executing projects to provide better economic and educational prospects for people in Ethiopia. Starbucks subsequently announced that the company was in conversation with the Ethiopian Prime Minister to workout an amicable settlement. After so much pressure from the public, the Ethiopian government and Starbucks reached an agreement and Starbucks signed a license agreement acknowledging Ethiopia's 'ownership' of the trademark. 

- Having reached an amicable settlement with its former major adversary, Ethiopia had the final hurdle of ensuring the registration of Sidamo as a trademark in the US. In combatting the opinion of the USPTO that Sidamo was descriptive of the goods, Ethiopia argued that Sidamo is actually a geographic term for a region in Ethiopia, which had acquired distinctiveness and had become widely recognised relying on the license agreements that had been executed by the major coffee retailers in the US. 

- The argument presented by the government of Ethiopia was accepted by the USPTO and 'Sidamo' was approved for publication as a trademark in October 2007 and eventually registered as a trademark in February 2008 marking the end of the 3-year long hassle. 

##  5. What Does the Judge Say 
- In reaching its initial decision that the SIDAMO mark was not eligible for registration in the United States because it was descriptive of the goods identified, the USPTO stated that:
> **Section 2(e)(1) Refusal—Generic Notwithstanding Section 2(f) Claim**
>
>  The examining attorney refuses registration on the Principal Register because the proposed mark is generic for the goods. Trademark Act Section 2(e)(1), 15 U.S.C. §1052(e)(1); TMEP §§1209 *et seq.* The proposed mark is incapable of serving as a source-identifier for applicant’s goods, notwithstanding applicant’s claim of acquired distinctiveness under Section 2(f), 15 U.S.C. §1052(f).
>
> The attached evidence from Google shows that the proposed mark SIDAMO is incapable as used in connection with coffee because it is a recognized type of coffee and coffee bean. 
>
>  Accordingly, the mark is refused registration on the Principle Register under section 2(e)(1).
>
> Although the examining attorney has refused registration, the applicant may respond to the refusal to register by submitting evidence and arguments in support of registration.

## 6. Fun Fact
A wide-spread folklore goes that an Ethiopian goat herder called Kaldi first discovered coffee when he saw his goats become very energetic after feasting on some mysterious berries and as a result decided to try it himself and  found that they had stimulating effect. 


## 7. Linked knowledge 
- Existing knowledge on this issue have failed to address what happens in a situations where an applicant, after being refused an application for a trademark on grounds that the mark is descriptive and not distinctive, goes ahead to rally enough support and create mechanisms to bolster and influence the distinctiveness of the mark in a bid to gain control/manipulate the decision of the trademark office regarding such mark having created/influenced an atmosphere to support distinctiveness of the mark. Should this be ethical? Should it be encouraged practice as displayed by the government of Ethiopia in this case? Would this not amount to lobbying?
