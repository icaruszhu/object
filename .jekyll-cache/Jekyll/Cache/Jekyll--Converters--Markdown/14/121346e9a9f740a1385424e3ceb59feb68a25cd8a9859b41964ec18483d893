<h2 id="2-object-summary">2. Object Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Yogurt is a form of fermented milk. Originally, yoghurt produced in Greece was made mostly from goat’s milk. However, in response to increased demand and consumer preference for food with lower fat content, yoghurt production was extended to cows’ milk. Greek yoghurt is a special brand of yoghurt characterised by a rich, thick and creamy texture. Yoghurt made from goat’s milk did not require concentration to achieve a thick texture. However, with cow’s milk, the thick texture was achieved by a unique method of production known as ‘straining’. Straining is the process of separating and removing the watery whey from fermented milk either by using cloth bags, centrifugation or ultra-filtration.</li>

<h2 id="4--legal-dispute">4.  Legal Dispute</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The claimant was Fage UK Limited, a company that imports yoghurt described as ‘greek yoghurt’ from Greece to the United Kingdom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The defendant was Chobani UK Limited, a turkish-owned business established in the USA sometime in 2005, which subsequently expanded its market to the UK by introducing to the UK market a USA-produced yoghurt which it described as ‘greek yoghurt’.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fage began producing yoghurt in Greece in the late 1920s and its yoghurt has always had the thick and creamy consistency characterised by Greek yoghurt. Fage introduced its yoghurt into the UK market in 1983 under the brand name ‘Total’ and clearly described and marketed as greek yoghurt.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to Chobani’s attempt to infiltrate the UK greek yoghurt market, Fage had only 3 other major competitors in the UK– Tesco, Asda and Kolio (which sold its yoghurt through the Costco warehouse chain). The greek yoghurt marketed and sold by Fage and its other UK competitors had been produced in Greece and the thick and creamy consistency had been achieved by straining. From the introduction of greek yoghurt into the UK market in the 1980s up until 2012, there was a labeling convention in the UK</p>

<p>whereby the only brand of yoghurt offered for sale with the description ‘greek yoghurt’ had to have been produced in Greece with its thickness and creaminess achieved by straining. Manufacturers in the UK that sold thick and creamy yoghurt, which had not been produced in Greece nor rendered thick by straining, sold their products with the description ‘greek style yoghurt’. Greek yoghurts sell at a premium price and are much more expensive compared to other yoghurt types especially the ones described as ‘greek style yoghurt’.</p>

<p>Upon becoming aware of Chobani’s US-produced yoghurt being described as ‘greek yoghurt’, Fage began proceedings in court, first by seeking an interim injuction, which was granted by the trial Judge in November 2012.</p>

<p>Fage’s main argument was that all, or substantially all, of the yoghurt products sold in the UK with the description ‘Greek Yoghurt’ had complied with the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The yoghurt was produced in Greece</li>
  <li>The yoghurt was produced using the Greek traditional process of straining</li>
  <li>The yoghurt contained no added sugar, non-milk thickeners, sweeteners or other additives.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fage further argued that a valuable reputation of goodwill had been generated under and associated with the phrase ‘Greek Yoghurt’ in the UK and that Fage was one of those that shared in that goodwill.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The trial judge identified one central factual issue and one central legal issue from the parties’ submissions:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The factual issue was whether the labelling convention pursuant to which ‘greek yoghurt’ was properly qualified as so was reflected in a similar understanding on the part of the consumers or atleast a proportion of it.</p>

        <p>On this issue, Fage argued that buyers of thick and creamy yoghurt generally believed that such yoghurt described as ‘greek yoghurt’ came from Greece using a unique process that attributed to its creaminess and thickness. Chobani, in its counter-argument, stated that ‘greek yogurt’ did not denote a clearly identifiable and distinctive class of products, arguing that the phrase is merely used in defining its method of production i.e. straining and not the place of origin.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The legal issue concerned the identification of the requisite section and proportion of the public which, as consumers of the product in question, must be shown to have a common understanding of the meaning of the phrase sought to be protected in order to establish the existence of a relevant goodwill.</p>

        <p>The court established that the legal question can be resolved with the following questions:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Whether the claimant had built up substantial goodwill under the name by which it had described the product;</li>
          <li>whether the defendant’s use of same or similar name has caused or threatens to cause substantial damage to that goodwill.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the trial court’s judgment delivered on the 26th of March 2013, Briggs J found that a significant proportion of greek yoghurt consumers in the UK thought that it was made in Greece and this qualification mattered to them such that the use of the phrase ‘greek yoghurt’ to describe yoghurt that is not actually produced and imported from Greece would amount to material misrepresentation. Therefore, the trial court found that Fage’s claim to restrain Chobani from passing off its US-produced yoghurt as ‘greek yoghurt’, thereby insinuating that it was produced in Greece, suceeded and the trial judge granted a permanent injunction restraining Chobani from marketing its US-produced yoghurt with the description ‘greek yoghurt’ in the UK.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chobani, being dissatisfied with the decision at the trial court, filed an appeal on three main grounds:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The phrase ‘greek yoghurt’ was a general term which described a very wide range of products, including its American-produced yoghurt that it intended for sale in the UK.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Fage wholly failed to prove that the phrase ‘greek yoghurt’ had become sufficiently distinctive of a definitive category of products in order to serve as a foundation in law for an action in passing off.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Seeking to raise and rely on a new point of Law, Chobani argued that in view of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 1151/2012 of November 2012 on the protection of designations of origin and geographical indicatins for foodstuff within the EU (the “EU Regulation”) and the ruling in <em>Budejovicky Budnar NP v. Rudolf Ammersin GmbH</em></p>

        <p>, the trial court had no power to grant and was precluded from granting injunctive relief to protect geographic indications, such as greek yoghurt, except as strictly provided in the EU Regulation; or alternatively, subject to the fulfillment of conditions and in circumstances equivalent to those provided in the EU Regulation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Court of Appeal categorised Chobani’s grounds of appeal under two main heads–</p>
        <ul>
          <li>distinctiveness and deception;</li>
          <li>the EU Regulation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In determining the issue of distinctiveness and deception as it relates to passing off, the CA considered a pletora of prior decided cases, most notable of all being <em>Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap and anor. v. J Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd and anor.</em></p>

    <p>, wherein Lord Diplock outlined five major characteristics of a valid cause of action for passing off as–</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A misrepresentation</li>
      <li>made by a trader in the course of trade</li>
      <li>to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him</li>
      <li>which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader in a reasonably forseeable manner</li>
      <li>which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or will probably do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the instant case, the CA found that these requirements were satisfied and all five characteristics were present. The CA summarises the following as the essential elements of a passing off claim–</p>

    <ul>
      <li>goodwill,</li>
      <li>misrepresentation, and</li>
      <li>damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ther court relying on Lord Fraser’s judgment in <em>Erven Warnink Besloten Vennootschap and anor. v. J Townend &amp; Sons (Hull) Ltd and anor.</em></p>

    <p>emphasised that a claimant need not show that the name sought to be protected is known to, and in the case of a descriptive name, has actually acquired a secondary meaning amongst potential consumers, futher stating that the terms ‘descriptive’ and distinctive’ are not mutually exclusive in this context; therefore, a name which started off as merely being descriptive may with time become both distinctive and descriptive. The court further states that what a claimant must show by evidence is that such name or phrase is sufficiently well known and sufficiently distinctive that the actions of the defendant in using same or similar names to describe different goods amounts to misrepresentation, which is calculated to cause the claimant damage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In defining how to establish goodwill, the court relied on the decision in <em>Chocosuisse Union des Fabricants Suisse de Chocolat v. Cadbury Ltd</em></p>

    <p>wherein it was established that a court must deduce what the word/phrase means to the public– if they are nothing more than descriptive, then there is no passing off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court on the concept of ‘extended passing off’, which the instant case has been decribed to illustrate, stated that the term is no different from conventional passing off because in an extended passing off case, the allegation is not that the defendant has, by the use of the name, misrepresented its goods as those of the claimant but rather that it has misrepresentated its goods as those of a class of traders of whom the claimant need only be one. The goodwill being claimed by the defendant is not that of one specific trader alone but shared amongst a class of traders that is not necessarily fixed as other traders may join in it and fall out of it respectively. The CA further established that both kinds of passing off satisfy the requirements established by Lord Diplock and Lord Fraser in <em>Erven Warnink case</em></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also relying on the <em>Erven Warnink Besloten decision</em>, the Court found that for a claimant to succeed in an extended passing off case, he must show that the class of traders whose products the name in contention is said to have become distinctive can be defined with reasonable precision. The Claimant must also show that the name has come to denote a specific kind of product that has recognisable characteristics, which distinguish it from other products and that the consumers are motivated to buy the product because of those unique qualities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the issue of whether the EU Regulation accords protection to the phrase ‘greek yoghurt’ such as to preclude the trial court from granting injunctive relief as submitted by the Appellant’s counsel, the CA disagreed for two reasons–</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The regulation only extends to products for which there is a specific link between their characteristics and their geographical origin.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A name which can be registered as protected under the regulation must be a name by which the product is known in the language which is or was historically used to describe the product in the defined geographical area in question</p>

        <p>The court explains that said article contemplates the registration of one name, which will then be used (with applicable translations) throughout the European Union; therefore, because what is described as ‘Greek Yoghurt’ in the UK is called ‘strained yoghurt’ in Greece, the name ‘Greek Yoghurt’ is incapable of registration under the EU regulation.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Having set forth all its reasons, the CA upheld the decision of the trial court and the appeal was dismissed.</li>
  <li>The decision was unanimous as both Lord Justices Longmore and Lewison agreed with the lead judgment of Kitchin LJ for the appeal to be dismissed.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="5-what-does-the-judge-say">5. What Does the Judge Say</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On the issue of likelihood of confusion, the CA relied on Morrit LJ’s position in <em>Neutrogena Corporation and anor. v. Golden Ltd. and anor</em></p>

    <p>where the court established that:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>there is no dispute as to what the correct legal principle is. As stated by Lord Oliver of Aylmerton in <em>Reckitt &amp; Colman Products Ltd. v. Borden Inc.</em> [1990] RPC 341 at page 407, the question on the issue of deception of confusion is</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Is it, on a balance of probabilities, likely that, if the appellants are not restrained as they have been, a substantial number of members of the public will be misled into purchasing the defendants’ product in the belief that it is the respondents’ product.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The same proposition is stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England 4th Edition Vol. 48 para 148.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-fun-fact">6. Fun Fact</h2>

<p>The origin of the word ‘yogurt’ can be traced to the Turkish verb ‘yogurmak’ which means to thicken, coagulate or curdle. It is recorded that the first consumption of yoghurt was by Central Asian herdsmen, who stored their extra goat’s milk in containers made from animal stomachs to preverse it while on their journey and were shocked to see that some of the stored milk became thick and tart but was still consunmable.</p>

<h2 id="7-linked-knowledge">7. Linked knowledge</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Goodwill as defined in <em>Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Muller &amp; Co.’s Margarine Ltd.</em></p>

    <p>is</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>and essentially what makes customers trust and remain loyal to the brand. The court in the instant case broadened the scoped of what can satisfy goodwill where consumers do not fully understand what makes the claimant’s product different from others in the market. The court identified that the buying public’s perception about the differences between ‘Greek yoghurt’ ahd ‘Greek style yoghurt’ stems rather from a place of confusion as opposed to understanding and appreciation. However, what mattered to the court in this case was that the buying public recognised the phrase ‘Greek yoghurt’ to mean yoghurt imported from greece with special unique qualities. The court in its analysis gave consideration majorly to the need for protection of goodwill but does not explore the consumer protection perspective of the misrepresentation/deception subtheme of the decision. Moreover, it would appear that the English court’s dispositions towards cases involving passing off has been to expand the scope of existing authorities in order to ensure protection of the rights holder. This concern was justifiable raised by Rix LJ in <em>Diageo North America Inc. v. Intercontinental Brands (ICB) Ltd.</em></p>

    <p>where the learned Judge stated that the House of Lords in the <em>Erven Warnink Case</em> did not intend to extend the principle of passing off to a situtaion where a claimant sues to protect a shared reputation in the manufacture or distribution of a generic product, which is distinctive primarily because it extends to the whole of a broad category of products; further stating that extended passing off should not by means of extension upon extension result in trespass beyond legitimate protection of goodwill into an illegitimate area of anti-competitiveness.</p>

    <p>The court’s analysis in this case also fails to consider the possibility that a phrase that started off as descriptive and following increased used becomes distinctive could in the same vein become so popular and widely used that it becomes generic.</p>
