<ul>
  <li>The Plaintiffs in this case are:
    <ul>
      <li>Melissa Ferrick, individually and doing business as Nine Two One Music and Rights on Records/Publishing</li>
      <li>Jaco Pastorius, Inc.</li>
      <li>Gerencia 360 Publishing, Inc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit on behalf of themselves and the settlement class.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Defendant is Spotify USA, Inc. a digital music streaming and download service that grants users access to millions of songs and content from artistes.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to legally provide the music and content on its platform to its users, Spotify must have first obtained a license for use of such music or content from the rightsholders for such content, failure of which they would be liable for copyright infringement. This basic fact formed the ground for the plaintiffs’ claims in this case.  The plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint in which they alleged that musicial compositions, for which themselves and members of a putative class had copyright, were reproduced and distributed by the defendant without a license thereby violating Section 101 of the Copyright Act. Spotify denied any fault, wrongdoing or liability of any kind to the Plaintiffs and the settlement class but agreed to explore settlement to ‘avoid the expense, uncertainty, and distraction of burdensome and protracted litigation.’</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before the case went to hearing, the parties engaged in extensive negotiations with the aid of a mediator with representatives from each party.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parties settled the matter amicably out of court and filed the settlement agreement before the court for approval. The court entered an order granting preliminary approval of the proposed settlement on the 29th day of June 2017. The preliminary approval order authorised the plaintiffs to disemminate the notice of the settlement, fairness hearing, and related matters to the class of persons represented in the case. The plaintiffs issued the notice as ordered by the court on the 3rd day of August 2017 and the fairness hearing was held on the 1st day of December 2017.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Claim process as described in Section 3.2 of the Settlement Agreement required the settlement administrator to create a settlement website</p>

    <p>to provide all important notices and instructions for settlement class members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 6 of the Settlement Agreement also provides for the creation of a six-person Mechanical Licensing Committee, to whom Spotify will present confidential reports detailing its efforts to reduce the rate of unmatched works on its platform at each committee meeting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section 7 of the Settlement Agreement also provides for the Copyright Data Sharing Committee (CDSC) with membership from– the Recording Industry Association of America; the American Society of Composers, Authors and Performers; Broadcast Music, Inc.; the Society of European Stage Authors and Composers; Global Music Rights; Universal Music Publishing Group; Sony/ATV Music Publishing; Warner/Chappell Music; Apple, Inc.; Amazon Digital Services LLC; Google, Inc.; and Pandora Media, Inc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The functions of the CDSC were highlighted in Section 7.2 of the settlement agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court in its final judgment approving the class action settlement, excluded the following from the settlement class:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Spotify and its affiliates, employees, and counsel;</li>
      <li>Federal, state and local government entities;</li>
      <li>the Court;</li>
      <li>Persons and entities who, in 2016, executed a Participating Publisher Pending and Unmatched Usage Agreement in connection with the Pending and Unmatched Usage Agreement, dated 17th March 2016 executed between Spotify and the National Music Publishers’ Association;</li>
      <li>Any other person or entity who has agreed not to bring a claim against spotify in the instant case; and</li>
      <li>Any person or entity who has already provided Spotify with a release with respect to claims concerning musical compositions for which a certificate of registration has been issued or applied for, but the exclusion applies solely with respect to such released claims.</li>
      <li>Individuals and entities who requested exclusion from the class within the timeframe provided only as it relates to claims involving musical compositions properly identified by copyright registration number in their requests for exclusion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court granted full and final approval of the settlement agreement as it determined that its terms were fair, reasonable, and adequate as defined by Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The action was therefore dismissed with prejudice to Spotify and without any costs to either party except as provided in Section 15 of the Settlement Agreement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court further approved the following as Qualified Settlement Fund pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Settlement Fund Escrow into which Spotify was to deposit $43,450,000;</li>
      <li>The Attorneys’ Fee Escrow Account into which Spotify was to to deposit $5,000,000</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Court, in its judgment, also established that neither the settlement nor any acts or documents executed as a result thereof, may be deemed or used as evidence or admission of wrongdoing in any civil, criminal, administrative, or other proceeding in any jurisdiction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The court also approved the distribution plan.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There were several appeals filed after the Court’s final judgement and they were all dismissed. Although, the final judgment of the court was given on 22 May 2018, the effective date is 15 April 2019</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On 10th May 2021, the Court entered an order amending the Settlement Agreement to permit class members claim their works through the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) Portal.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-what-does-the-judge-say">5. What Does the Judge Say</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the preliminary approval order dated 3rd August 2017, pursuant to United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, the court defined the settlement class as:
    <blockquote>
      <p>All persons or entities who own copyrights in one or more musical compositions (a) for which a certificate of registration has been issued or applied for on or before the preliminary approval date; and (b) that was made available by spotify for interactive streaming and/or limited downloads during the Class period (December 28, 2012 through the Preliminary Approval Date) without a license.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-fun-fact-one-paragraph">6. Fun Fact [one paragraph]</h2>
<p>Despite Spotify’s popularity and acceptance by majority of artists in the music industry, industry giants like Taylor Swift and Jay Z, have spoken publicly against the streaming platform, calling it an ‘experiment’. In fact, Jay Z went on to become a competitor by launching his own music streaming service–Tidal–in 2016.</p>

<h2 id="7-linked-knowledge">7. Linked knowledge</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Although it refused to acknowledge or admit to any wrongdoing in this case, Spotify has been faced with other copyright infringement cases all of which it chose to settle amicably since the company’s launch in 2008, it would appear it runs an infringe now-apoligize later model. The continued ability to settle these matters amicably has perhaps made this a business norm for the music streaming platform, which inadvertently means the company continues to disregard copyright and the respective rights as guaranteed by law.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Music Modernization Act (MMA) is a collection of 3 laws that update the legal process and framework for digital music licensing</p>

    <p>The Act comprises three laws–</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Musical Works Modernization Act: creates a blanket license for interactive music streaming services and establishes the Mechanical Licensing Collective Inc. (MLC) to collect and distribute mechanical royalty payments as well as the Digital Licensee Coordinator (DLC) to regulate the process of granting and obtaining licenses.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Classics Protection and Access Act: created federal rights for owners of sound recordings made before 15th February 1972.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Allocation for Music Producers Act: creates a system fof the collection of certain royalties for music producers, mixers, and sound engineers.</p>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Through the enactment of the MMA, the law has identified and remedied the cracks in the music licensing process, which resulted in class actions such as the Melissa Ferrick case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Statutorty provisions
    <ul>
      <li>Section 501 Copyright Act 1976, 17 U.S.C</li>
      <li>Section 1715 Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) 28 U.S.C</li>
      <li>Rule 23, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure</li>
      <li>Section 468B Internal Revenue Code</li>
      <li>The Music Mordernization Act 17 U.S. § 115.</li>
